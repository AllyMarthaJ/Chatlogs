# Chatlogs
A quick Minecraft-related chatlogs searcher.

## How to run this program?
Simply put, all you have to do is open it. The folder path for logs is set to (and currently hardcoded to) your %appdata%\.minecraft\logs. 

You may then enter in an exact query (case insensitive, using `Contains()`). The program will list results and files as it's searching.

You will have the option to save the results as a file, in the same directory.

## I've found a bug!
Open an Issue, this is to be expected. The program currently only runs on Windows machines.
